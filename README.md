# TriangleTrash

Simple cli implementation of the Delta Dash game that Optiver likes to run during campus talks. Since Optiver already rejected me, I'll just practice trading against myself :(

To compile, run `make`. In a terminal instance, run `./triangletrash`. Then on separate terminal instances, run `nc localhost 8080` to connect to the game server.

Have fun!
